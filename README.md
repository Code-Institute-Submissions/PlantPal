Wireframes for the dashboard can be found in the assets folder of the repository.

## User stories
### User story 1:
As a newcomer to the keeping houseplants, I would like to be able to search houseplants by their name so that I can find out what the most appropriate care for each of my plants would be.

### User story 2:
As a plant enthusiast, I would like to be able to browse plants by genus so that I can discover more species of plants that belong to a particular family/genus that I am fond of.

### User story 3:
As a Biology student, I would like to be able to find out information about different orders and genus of plants for my school project on plant types.

### User story 4:
As a house plant enthusiast, I would like to be able to browse various plants by their preferred lighting conditions so that I can ascertain which plants will thrive in different areas of my home that have different lighting availabilty.

## Features

### Existing Features

- The site allows users to search for plants via the plant's latin name or common name using the search bar and returns the appropriate page containing all the relevant information on that particular plant including best care practices and images of the plant.

- The site also allows users to browse plants by categories such as their family or genus and then allows users to view all species within the selected category.

- Users are able to submit details of new plants to the database via the 'Add a Plant' page, including details such as the plant's Latin name, common name, genus, preferred ligthting conditions and watering frequency, as well as an image of the plant in order to better illustrate to other users what that particular plant is.

- The site allows for users to browse plants by their preferred lighting conditon so that the user can work out what plants may thrive best in a particular area of their home or garden based on the lighting available and select a plant they like to place in that particular area.

### Features Left to Implement

- In future versions of the app, I would like to add functionality for users to take a photograph of a plant they have found that they may not know the name of, so that the app can then tell the user what the name of the plant they have photographed is, and redirect them to that particular plant's page within the site.

- I would also like to implement functionality for the user to photograph a particular location where they would like to keep a plant, and based on the lighting conditions shown in the photograph, reccomend what types of plants may be well suited to the particular location.

## Technologies Used

- [HTML5](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Guide/HTML/HTML5)
    - The project uses HTML5 to construct the pages within the application.

- [CSS3](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS3)
    - The project uses CSS3 in order to style the HTML5 and Bootstrap elements and components.

- [JavaScript](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript)
    - The project uses JavaScript to add interactivity to the dashboard and to retrieve certain data from CSV files for graphs and charts.

- [Bootstrap (ver 4.3.1)](https://getbootstrap.com/)
    - The project uses the Bootstrap 4 grid and components in order to achieve a responsive layout, as well as Bootswatch theme Darkly for the colour scheme.

- [Python (ver 3.0)](https://www.python.org/download/releases/3.0/)
    - The project uses Python in order to wire up the database to the website's front end.

- [Jinja (ver 2.10)](https://jinja.palletsprojects.com/en/2.10.x/)
    - The project uses the Jinja templating langauge in order to extend the base HTML and prevent unnecessary repetition of HTML code, allowing the code to be reused where possible.

- [MySQL (ver 8.0)](https://www.mysql.com/)
    - The project uses MySQL to construct and manipulate the data stored in the database tables.

- [MongoDB (ver 4.2.0)](https://www.mongodb.com/)
    - The project uses MongoDB to host and store the databases used to store the required data for the project.

## Testing

- HTML code has been run through the [W3C Markup Validator](https://validator.w3.org/) and corrected accordingly.
